# Design Plan
Contains plans for the sites: colors, typography and layout. Considerations for the design compoenents necessary and the visual design for each module and page as well. 

## Colors
Energetic and bright colors were selected as the primary and secondary colors for the Florida Energy redesign to reflect the purpose of the consortium. Colors are not meant to reflect a particular university because it involves the cooperation between many.

| Primary | Secondary |
|---------|-----------|
|![#d3e057](https://placehold.it/15/d3e057/000000?text=+) `#d3e057`|![#e3f2fd](https://placehold.it/15/e3f2fd/000000?text=+) `#e3f2fd`|
|![#ffff89](https://placehold.it/15/ffff89/000000?text=+) `#ffff89`|![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`|
|![#9fae22](https://placehold.it/15/9fae22/000000?text=+) `#9fae22`|![#b1bfca](https://placehold.it/15/b1bfca/000000?text=+) `#b1bfca`|

## Typography
### Source Sans Pro
SourceÂ® Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.

### Lora
Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text.

A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay.

Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.

## Layout
### Design Components
| Compoent | Notes       | Pages |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Header + Nav | The primary navigation which contains the: logo, main links and search bar | All |
| Landing Photo | Provides a visual overview of what the FESC represents. | Home |
| Section | Revise the current text so that it the iformation given is easier to understand by anyone who visits. | All |
| Footer | Links the all 12 schools, quick links, contact information and newsletter signup form. | All |

### Inspiration
#### IBM Research
The website is clean and inviting and doesn't immediately overwhelm visitors with information. The social media links are displayed in a clever fashion --- visible, but also not within the direct line of sight.

#### Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research Center
As a university research center, the content must be understandable by a variety of different visitors. While the links in the navigation are minimal, it does have a nice quick form to subscribe to their newsletter.

#### NORC at the University of Chicago
In the main photo, there is a clear callout on the latest information. The top right also features social media links and how to contact them. The links in the navigation are also informative and the overall use of color is appealing.

#### Consortium for Global Education 
While the CGE doesn't have the best design, it has easy links targeting specific types of visitors (members, faculty, students and partners). There is also a twitter feed which can help show that they are active and engaged with their community.
