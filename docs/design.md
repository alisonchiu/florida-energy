# Design Plan
Contains plans for the sites: colors, typography and layout. Considerations for the design compoenents necessary and the visual design for each module and page as well. 

## Colors
Energetic and bright colors were selected as the primary and secondary colors for the Florida Energy redesign to reflect the purpose of the consortium. Colors are not meant to reflect a particular university because it involves the cooperation between many.

| Primary | Secondary |
|---------|-----------|
|![#d3e057](https://placehold.it/15/d3e057/000000?text=+) `#d3e057`|![#e3f2fd](https://placehold.it/15/e3f2fd/000000?text=+) `#e3f2fd`|

## Typography
### Source Sans Pro
SourceÂ® Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.

### Lora
Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text.

A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay.

Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.
